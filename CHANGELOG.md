# Change Log

## v 1.3
* Ported to Python 3.
* Fixed version so converter version doesn't appear twice.
* Added unit "entries" to the progress bars.

## v. 1.2
* Convert three dots (...) to the actual ellipsis character (â€¦) to avoid mistaking some words as abbreviations.
* Added abbreviations *sb* (somebody) and *sth* (something).
* Changed default output filename to `CC-CEDICT_publishingdate-converterversion`, hopefully making it clearer.

## v. 1.1
* Added arguments to define input and output files.
* Added progress bars.
* Added option of automatically downloading the most recent release of CC-CEDICT instead of using a pre-downloaded file.

## v. 1.0
First Version
