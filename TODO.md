# To Do


* Fix non-standard pinyin entries, mainly entries including one or more Latin letters.

  e.g.: "Ā QZhèngzhuàn";
* Add support for Pleco's [CC-Canto](http://cantonese.org/) Cantonese dictionary (as an optional addition).
* Add support for [Pleco's Cantonese readings](http://cantonese.org/download.html) (as an optional addition). (Possibly confusing in the current status of the XDXF standand.)
* Make the abbreviations list of tuples an external file (possibly unnecessary).
* Add not yet recognized abbreviations such as "hon".
* Recognize two internal references in the format "See also: "
* Decide and implement a format for internal references. E.g. 漢字|汉子 hanzi (if alternative writing systems and transliterations aren't added to the XDXF format.)
